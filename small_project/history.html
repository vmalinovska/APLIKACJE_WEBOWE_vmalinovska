            <h2>THE HISTORY OF <span style="color: var(--light-blue);">BLUE</span></h2>
            <p>The color blue has one of the most <i>fascinating</i> histories among all colors. For most of human history, it was extremely rare and difficult to obtain, which made it a special hue often reserved for the most important people or objects. In ancient Egypt, people were the first to create an artificial pigment — <i>Egyptian blue</i> — made from a mixture of limestone, copper, and sand, fired at high temperatures. In other cultures, such as Greece or Rome, blue was <i>scarce and insignificant</i>, and even difficult to describe—the ancient Greeks often did not distinguish it from green. For this reason, blue appeared mainly in <i>religious and symbolic</i> art for a long time, rather than in everyday life.</p>

        <div class="right-text">
            <p>The situation changed in the Middle Ages, when blue began to be associated with divinity, and depictions of the <i>Virgin Mary</i> were often painted with ultramarine — the most expensive pigment in the world, obtained from <i>lapis lazuli</i> imported from Afghanistan. During the Renaissance, blue gained importance thanks to the development of painting techniques and new pigments that were cheaper and more accessible. In the 19th century, the discovery of synthetic <i>Prussian blue</i> and the later invention of chemical pigments made blue a mass-produced color, present in fashion, art, and design. Today, it is one of <i>the most beloved</i> colors in the world, symbolizing calm, trust, technology, and infinity.</p>
